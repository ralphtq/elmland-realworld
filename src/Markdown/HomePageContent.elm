**InteroptX** exists to assist companies build modern applications that use knowledge graphs 
based on the W3C technologies 
[RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/), [RDF-STAR](https://www.w3.org/2021/12/rdf-star.html), 
[SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/), 
and [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/).

Our passion is in solving hard problems that require:

* Advanced data modeling for reusable component ontologies and support for aspects/traits
* Functional programming idioms
* Commodity tools and libraries
* Modern software engineering practices for:
  * Rapid iteration, 
  * Test-driven development,
  * High quality APIs,
  * Continuous Integration and Deployment

**InteroptX** builds computing frameworks, libraries and automation for data harmonization, 
aggregation and transformations.

Knowledge graphs are based on semantic technology standards.

Modern software engineering approaches are based on Functional Programming.
Together they achieve high quality, high performance and scalable transformations.

**InteroptX** provides consulting services and software assets for building
the computing frameworks, libraries and automation needed for data harmonization, 
aggregation and transformations.

We provide mentoring and jumpstarts on software engineering approaches for

* Functional Programming in Scala, Python and Elm
* Continuous integration and deployment

For the building of ontologies based on RDF and SHACL, and the use of SPARQL, **InteroptX** provides mentoring
and best practices.

Our services address the need to achieve high quality, high performance and scalable knowledge graph based applications.

InteroptX has built and reused many ontologies based on both OWL and SHACL.
We have transformed non-RDF data and reference data into RDF, for example:

* UML Models
* FRB's MDRM Data Dictionary
* EBA's FINREP Risk Indicators
* SNOMED

We have knowledge and experience of using both the functional programming and imperative approaches
to working with knowledge graphs in the following languages, and tools:

* Java, Scala, Haskell, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Elm
* TopBraid, Jena, Fuseki, GraphDB
* Visual Studio, IntelliJ, GitHub

knowledgeGraphs : MarkdownString
knowledgeGraphs =

  A **Knowledge Graph** is a set of nodes, links and attributes that define statements that
capture concepts, constraints, rules and data that provide a machine-processable data structure.

The semantics of the knowledge graph can be represented in RDF, SHACL, OWL or in property graphs.alias

Our interest is in RDF and SHACL representations.
"""


importanceContent : MarkdownString
importanceContent =
    """
Applications that use knowledge graphs are hard to build.
First there are key practices to be adopted for making and deploying of knowledge graphs.
Second making user interfaces based on semantic technologies is a new and demanding job.
Third scalability of data, of the user experience, and the developer experience are challenges.

**InteroptX's** reason for being is to provide consulting and assets for addressing these challenges.
